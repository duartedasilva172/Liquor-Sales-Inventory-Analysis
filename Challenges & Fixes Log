# ðŸ§ª Liquor Reordered Case Study â€“ Challenges & Fixes Log

This document logs real challenges encountered while building and cleaning the `liquor_reordered` dataset for Tableau dashboarding, and the solutions implemented to address them.

---

## ðŸ§© Challenge #1 â€“ Missing Supplier Values

**Issue:** Some records had `NULL` values for `SUPPLIER`, which would interfere with grouping and filtering.

**Fix:** Replaced all `NULL` values in `SUPPLIER` with the placeholder `'Not Recorded'` to retain row integrity while signaling incomplete data.

```sql
UPDATE [dbo].[db_liquor]
SET SUPPLIER = 'Not Recorded'
WHERE SUPPLIER IS NULL;
```

## ðŸ§© Challenge #2 â€“ Missing ITEM_TYPE Data

**Issue:** `ITEM_TYPE` values were missing for some rows, impacting analysis by category.

**Fix:** Used conditional logic based on `ITEM_CODE` to fill in known values. For example, code 347939 was classified as 'WINE'.

```sql
UPDATE db_liquor
SET ITEM_TYPE = 'WINE'
WHERE ITEM_TYPE IS NULL AND ITEM_CODE = 347939;
```

---

## ðŸ§© Challenge #3 â€“ Incomplete Date Formatting

**Issue:** Original data lacked a proper date field for visualization in Tableau.

**Fix:** Created a `full_date` column using `DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR, MONTH, 1)` to ensure all rows had a valid, consistent date.

```sql
ALTER TABLE db_liquor ADD full_date DATE;
UPDATE db_liquor
SET full_date = DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR, MONTH, 1);
```

## ðŸ§© Challenge #4 â€“ Negative Total Sales

**Issue:** Some rows had a negative sum of sales across channels, which disrupted visualizations and skewed insights.

**Fix:** Initially set negative totals to `0` and captured the negative values in a new `net_loss` column.

```sql
ALTER TABLE liquor_reordered ADD net_loss FLOAT;
UPDATE liquor_reordered
SET
  total_sales = CASE
    WHEN retail_sales + retail_transfers + warehouse_sales < 0 THEN 0
    ELSE retail_sales + retail_transfers + warehouse_sales
  END,
  net_loss = CASE
    WHEN retail_sales + retail_transfers + warehouse_sales < 0
    THEN retail_sales + retail_transfers + warehouse_sales
  END;
```

---

## ðŸ§© Challenge #5 â€“ Timeline Gaps in Tableau

**Issue:** Suppressing negative `total_sales` created gaps in the monthly timeline when visualized in Tableau.

**Fix:** Reverted `total_sales` to reflect real values (including negatives) and added two new columns: `net_loss` and `net_positive_sales` to separately analyze positive and negative performance.

```sql
ALTER TABLE liquor_reordered
ADD net_loss DECIMAL(18,2),
    net_positive_sales DECIMAL(18,2);

UPDATE liquor_reordered
SET
  net_loss = CASE
    WHEN total_sales < 0 THEN ABS(total_sales)
    ELSE 0
  END,
  net_positive_sales = CASE
    WHEN total_sales > 0 THEN total_sales
    ELSE 0
  END;
```

---

## ðŸ§© Challenge #6 â€“ CSV Export Truncation from Azure

**Issue:** CSV exports from the Azure portal were limited to 50,000 rows, despite the full table having 307,645 rows.

**Fix:** Switched to **Azure Data Studio**, which allowed full-query export and saved the complete dataset for Tableau integration.

## âœ… Summary

These issues were caught and corrected through a structured troubleshooting process, which enhanced the dataset's reliability, preserved time-series continuity, and enabled more insightful visual analysis in Tableau.
